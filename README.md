## Motivation
I started this project just because it was my software engineering course project. (I'm really a honest person ðŸ˜Š)

## Build Status
I'm currently completing the back-end and front-end.

## Code Style
I try my best to make my code as readable as possible, I use commenting as much as possible, I try to name my variables at least the necessary standard for readability, and so on.
